"`?X = ?X`. Here, I use `?X` to stand in for any expression of any type.\n"
"It could be `8 + 9` or `a * b` or `\"adele\"` or whatever.\n"

"proof isn't complete. You'll see a <span style=\"color:orange\">warning</span> message in the\n"

"tactic failed, there are unsolved goals. Don't panic! It's just telling you that you haven't yet\n"

"If you're successful, Lean will respond with the message `no goals` or `Proof complete!`\n"

"In `from rfl`, the word `from` is a *tactic*. This tactic takes a proof term and closes a goal\n"
