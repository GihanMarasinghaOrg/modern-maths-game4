Introduction "
Hi! We'll show that $a * b = b * a$.

'ring' can be used to simplify and prove equalities involving polynomial-like
expressions. Write 'ring' to solve the goal!"

/-- `ring`simplifys and proves equalities involving polynomial-like
expressions in commutative rings. It leverages the algebraic properties
 of addition and multiplication to handle complex expressions efficiently.
